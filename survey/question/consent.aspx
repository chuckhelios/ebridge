Welcome to the <I>e</I>Bridge study of college student mental health! Our goal is to learn more about how to provide support to college students who are experiencing mental or emotional difficulties. If you participate in this study, you will be asked to complete a brief web survey, <I>which takes less than 5 minutes for most participants</I>. You will then receive automated feedback about your current emotional health as well as suggestions for types of support or services you may want to consider. Please read more information about the study below, and then indicate at the bottom of the screen whether you are willing to participate in this study.

<DIV style='width:100%;background-color:#ECECEC;border:1px solid black;padding:3px;text-align:center'>GENERAL INFORMATION</DIV><P>

<B>Why are you doing this study?</B><P>

We are conducting research with college students to learn about <I>e</I>Bridge, a service to help link students with depression or other emotional difficulties to services or resources that may be helpful. We hope to learn about how to best implement <I>e</I>Bridge and to find out if it improves linkages to services or resources.<P>

<B>What is involved if I participate in this study?</B><P>

Participants are college students (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and second year graduate students 18 years and older) attending the <asp:label ID="SchoolName2" runat="server"/>.<P>

Your participation is voluntary&#151;your decision of whether to participate will not affect your standing at this university in any way, and you will not be penalized in any way if you decided not to participate. You may discontinue participation at any time.<P>

If you agree to participate, we will ask you to answer some questions online that take about 2-5 minutes (though they may take less or more time for some students). You will be asked questions about your race, ethnicity, thoughts, behaviors, and moods . You will also be asked questions about any services you may or may not have received. <P>

Regardless of whether you participate, you will be entered into a random drawing for gift cards (a $1000 gift card and ten $100 gift cards).The drawing will be conducted on February 13, 2012 by the <asp:label ID="SchoolDept1" runat="server"/> on <asp:label ID="DeptAddress1" runat="server"/> The odds of winning a prize are 1 in 637. Winners will be notified immediately by email. Student will be asked to provide your name and mailing address so prizes can be mailed.<P>

Some students will be invited to continue on to Part Two. These students will have an opportunity to view personalized feedback based on their responses. Half of these students will have the option to exchange online messages with a professional counselor. The counselor does not provide treatment and is unable to respond rapidly to online messages requiring immediate assistance for risk or harm to self or others. The other half will receive some information about local services.<P>

For those participating in Part Two, we will contact you again in two months for an online survey (lasting 8-10 minutes on average) about how you are doing and any services you have obtained. All those invited to participate in two months will receive a $10 gift card; those who complete the survey in two months will be offered an additional $25 online gift card for their time.<P>

<DIV style='width:100%;background-color:#ECECEC;border:1px solid black;padding:3px;text-align:center'>INFORMATION ABOUT RISKS AND BENEFITS</DIV><P>

<B>What are the risks associated with my participation?</B><P>

Some of the questions will ask you about sensitive or personal information such as your emotional health. These questions might make you feel uncomfortable or anxious. At the end of the survey you will receive a list of resources on campus that can provide help and support if ever needed. If responding to any questions makes you feel distressed, we urge you to call any of the resources listed.<P>

<B>What are the benefits from my participation in this research?</B><P>

We expect students may learn important information about available services. Some students may also link to needed services as a result of study participation.<P>

We expect this research to be used to gain an understanding of how to best provide links and resources for college students.<P>

<DIV style='width:100%;background-color:#ECECEC;border:1px solid black;padding:3px;text-align:center'>CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUBJECT RECORDS</DIV><P>

<B>How will my privacy and confidentiality be protected?</B><P>

It does not however, prevent you from choosing to disclose information that we obtain in this study to physicians or others.<P>

Although students are providing personal information transferred through a study website, we will only use identifying information (name and email address) to recruit students for participation, and we will never link this information to any of the study data (from the surveys and the correspondence via the web site). We will maintain a secure data environment using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.<P>

The data from this study, without any identifiable information, will be retained in a secure repository for future research purposes. Records will be kept confidential to the extent provided by federal, state, and local law. However, the Institutional Review Board, the sponsor of the study, or university and government officials responsible for monitoring this study may inspect these records.<P>
	
Should you accidentally leave a session open on a computer that may be viewed by others, the computer will automatically log-off. After 10 minutes of idle time, you will receive a notification that the session will be logged off in 1 minute unless you click to continue the session.<P>
