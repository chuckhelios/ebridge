Researchers at the University of Michigan, University of Iowa, University of Nevada-Reno, and Stanford University are conducting research with college students to learn about <i>e</i>Bridge,
a service to help link students with depression ot other emotional difficulties to services or resources that may be helpful.  We hope to learn about how to best implement <i>e</i>Bridge
and to find out if it improves linkages to services or resources.<P>

<DIV style='width:100%;background-color:#ECECEC;border:1px solid black;padding:3px;text-align:center'>GENERAL INFORMATION</DIV><P>

University of Michigan Students (18 years or older) are eligible to participate in the study.  We anticipate 909 students to participate at the University of Michigan, and 2305 across all sites.
Your participation is voluntary--your decision of whether to participate will not affect your standing at this university in any way, and you will not be penalized in any way if you decide not to participate.
You may discontinue participation at any time.<P>

<b>What is involved if I participate in this study?</b><P>
<b>Part 1:</b><br>
If you agree to participate, we will ask you to complete an online survey that will take either take 2 to 5 minutes or 8 to 10 minutes, depending upon the number of questions incuded in your survey.
All students will be asked questions about their age, race, ethnicity, thoughts, behaviors, and moods.  All students will be asked about their use of mental health services.  
Some students will be asked additional questions about their emotions and behaviors, views about mental health services, and academic functioning.  The survey will require a total of 8 to 10 minutes for these students.
We anticipate that approximately  5 to 10 percent of students will be presented these additional questions.  These students will be identified based on their responses to the first set of questions.
They are students for whom we anticipate that the <i>e</i>Bridge intervention may be helpful.<P>

<b>Part 2:</b><br>
All students who complete the longer online survey will have an opportunity to view personalized feedback regarding their survey responses.  
Approximately one-half of these students will be randomly selected to participate in the <i>e</i>Bridge intervention,
which will present them with the option of exchanging online messages with a professional counselor about their personalized feedback , their concerns and/or the availability of resources in the campus community.
For the randomization each student has approximately a 50-50 chance of of being assigned to the <i>e</i>Bridge group or the personalized feedback and information services group only.<P>

We may obtain records from your university's counseling center or mental health clinic to determine if you have utilized mental health services during your participation in the study.
We may also obtain your academic records (e.g. enrollment, grade point average) to assess your academic functioning during the study.  These records will be used for research purposes only and will be kept confidential by the research team.<P>

<b>Personalized Feedback Group:</b><br>
You will receive personalized feedback regarding your survey responses that will include information about local services available.<br>
We will contact you four weeks later and approximately five to six months later for online follow-up surveys (lasting 6-10 minutes) about how your are doing and any services you have obtained.<p>
<b>Online Message group:</b><br>
You will receive personalized feedback regarding your survey responses that will include information about local services available and you will have the option to exchange online messages with professional counselor.<br />
The counselor does not provide treatment and is unable to respond rapidly to online messages requiring immediate assistance for risk or harm to self or others.<br>
We will contact you again four weeks later and approximately five to six months later for online follow-up surveys (lasting 6-10) about how you are doing and any services you have obtained.<P>

<DIV style='width:100%;background-color:#ECECEC;border:1px solid black;padding:3px;text-align:center'>FINANCIAL INFORMATION</DIV><P>
<b>Will I be paid or given anything for taking part in the study?</b><br>
Regardless of whether or not you participate, you wil be automatically entered into a random drawing for gift cards (ten $100 gift cards at each participating university).
The drawing will be conducted at the University of Michigan on November 14, 2014.  Winners will be notified by email within three business days and asked to provide their names and mailing address so prizes can be mailed.
You may opt out of the drawing by contacting the researchers by email.<br>
If you participate in Part 2 of the study, you will receive a $10 gift card for completion of the intial survey.  You will also receive an additional $15 gift card for completing the four week survey
and an additional $25 gift card for completing the five to six month survey.<P>

<b>I have to pay anything to participate in the study?</b><br>
There are no costs to you for participating in this study.<P>

<DIV style='width:100%;background-color:#ECECEC;border:1px solid black;padding:3px;text-align:center'>INFORMATION ABOUT RISKS AND BENEFITS</DIV><P>
<b>What are the risks associated with my participation</b><br>
Some of the questions will ask you about sensitive or personal information such as your emotional health. 
These questions might make you feel uncomfortable or anxious. At the end of the survey you will receive a list of resources on campus that can provide help and support if ever needed. 
If responding to any questions makes you feel distressed, we urge you to call any of the resources listed. 
There is also risk that information about you could be discovered by those who are not part of the research team. <P>

<b>What are the benefits from my participation in the this research?</b><br>
You may not receive any personal or direct benefits from being in this study.  We expect students may learn important information about available services. 
Some students may also link to needed services as a result of study participation. 
We expect this research to be used to gain an understanding of how to best provide links and resources for college students.<P>

<DIV style='width:100%;background-color:#ECECEC;border:1px solid black;padding:3px;text-align:center'>CONFIDENTIALITY OF SUBJECT RECORDS</DIV><P>

<b>How will my privacy and confidentiality be protected?</b><br>
We will do everything we can to protect your privacy. We will obtain a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institute of Health for this study. 
This protects us from having to release information that could be used to identify you.  
It allows us to refuse to disclose such information in any civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, whether at the federal, state, or local level. 
It does not however, prevent you from choosing to disclose information that we obtain in this study to physicians or others.<br>

We will maintain a secure data environment using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. 
Although students are providing personal information transferred through a study website, we will never link this information to any of the study data (from the surveys and from the correspondence via the website). 
We will only use identifying information (name  and email address) to recruit students for participation, 
contact students who win gift cards in the random drawing, to obtain records (see additional information below), 
or to contact you for optional participation in future phases of this project.  
We will keep your contact information on file after the six month assessment in order to keep you updated on the progress of the study and to contact you for possible participation in future phases of the study. 
Your contact information will be stored in a password protected data file, which will only be available to the research staff. <br>

The data from this study, without any identifiable information, will be retained in a secure repository for future research purposes. 
Records will be kept confidential to the extent provided by federal, state, and local law. 
However, the Institutional Review Board, the sponsor of the study, or university and government officials responsible for monitoring this study may inspect these records.<br>

Should you accidentally leave a session open on a computer that may be viewed by others, the computer will automatically log-off. 
After 10 minutes of idle time, you will receive a notification that the session will be logged off in 1 minute unless you click to continue the session.<br>
    
Agreeing to participate in this study gives the researchers your permission to obtain, use, and share information about you for this study, and is required in order for you to take part in the study.  
Information about you may be obtained from any hospital, doctor, and other health care provider involved in your care, including:
<ul>
    <li>Mental health care records (except psychotherapy notes not kept in your medical records)</li>
    <li>All records relateing to your condition, the treatment you have received, and your response to the treatment</li>
</ul><p>

There are many reasons why information about you may be used or seen by the researchers or others during or after this study.  Examples include:
<ul>
    <li>The researchers may need the information to make sure you can take part in the study</li>
    <li>The researchers may need the information to check your test results or look for side effects.  University, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and/or other government officials may need the information to make sure that the study is done in a safe and proper manner. </li>
