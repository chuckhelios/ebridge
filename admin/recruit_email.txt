Dear _NAME_FIRST_,

We invite you to participate in a confidential online research study, being conducted at U-M, about mental health and general well being among college students. Our goals are to understand the service needs of students and examine the usefulness of e-Bridge, an online program that may help link students to supportive services. Regardless of whether you participate, you will be entered into a random drawing for visa gift cards (a $1000 visa card and ten $100 visa cards).

The initial survey takes about 1-2 minutes. Some students will be asked additional questions and receive personal feedback comparing their results to other students. You may also be invited to participate in a second phase of the study.

To participate now, please follow these steps:

Sincerely,
