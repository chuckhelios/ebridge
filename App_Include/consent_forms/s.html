<br>&nbsp;<br>

				Welcome to the <i>e</i>Bridge study of college student mental health! Our goal is to learn more about how to provide support to college students who are experiencing mental or emotional difficulties. If you participate in this study, you will be asked to complete a brief web survey, <i>which takes less than 5 minutes for most participants</i>. You will then receive automated feedback about your current emotional health as well as suggestions for types of support or services you may want to consider. Please read more information about the study below, and then indicate at the bottom of the screen whether you are willing to participate in this study.

        <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>
        You are invited to participate in a research study on e-Bridge, a service to link students with depression or other emotional difficulties to services or
        resources. We hope to learn about how to best implement e-Bridge and to find out if it improves linkages to services or resources. Your participation is
        voluntary--your decision of whether to participate will not affect your standing at this university in any way, and you will not be penalized in any way if
        you decide not to participate. You may discontinue participation at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
        You will be asked to complete an online survey if you agree to participate. Depending on the questions you are asked, this survey will take anywhere from
        approximately 3 to 12 minutes. You will be asked questions about your race, ethnicity, thoughts, behaviors, and moods. You may also be asked questions
        about any mental health services you may or may not have received and your views about such services.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regardless of whether you participate, you will be automatically entered into a random drawing for gift cards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some students will be invited to continue on to Part Two. These students will have an opportunity to view personalized feedback regarding their survey
        responses. Approximately one-half of these students will have the option to exchange online messages with a professional counselor. The counselor does not
        provide treatment and is unable to respond rapidly to online messages requiring immediate assistance for risk or harm to self or others. All students in
        Part Two will be presented with information about local services.
    </p>
    <p>
        For those participating in Part Two, we will contact you again four weeks later and approximately five to six months later for online follow-up surveys
        (lasting 5-12 minutes) about how you are doing and any services you have obtained. All those invited to participate in these surveys will receive a $10
        gift card; with an additional $15 for completing the four week survey and an additional $25 for completing the five to six month survey.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>RISKS AND BENEFITS:</strong>
        The risks associated with this study are: some of the questions will ask you about sensitive or personal information such as your emotional health. These
        questions might make you feel uncomfortable or anxious. At the end of the survey you will receive a list of resources on campus that can provide help and
        support if ever needed. If responding to any questions makes you feel distressed, we urge you to call any of the resources listed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The benefits which may reasonably be expected to result from this study are: students may learn important information about available services. Some
        students may also link to needed services as a result of study participation. We expect this research to be used to gain an understanding of how to best
        provide links and resources for college students. We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your decision whether or not to participate in this study will not affect your student status or health care.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>TIME INVOLVEMENT:</strong>
        Your participation in this experiment will take approximately 3 to 12 minutes, depending on the questions you are asked. For those participating in Part
        Two, we will contact you again four weeks later and approximately five to six months later for online follow-up surveys each lasting 5-12 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>PAYMENTS:</strong>
        You will be entered into a drawing to win one of ten $100 gift cards. All students invited to participate in Part II of the study will receive a $10 gift
        card; with an additional $15 for completing the four week survey and an additional $25 for completing the five to six month survey.
    </p>
    <p>
        Payments may only be made to U.S. citizens, legal resident aliens, and those who have a work eligible visa. You may need to provide your social security
        number to receive payment.
